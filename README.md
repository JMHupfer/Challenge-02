# Challenge-02
Second Bootcamp Challenge

In this challenge I created a profile that has a functioning navigation bar that scrolls to each section in the webpage as well as a link to my CV. I made an about me section going over some small details of my life, a card section linking you to different projects that I have and will work on, and at the end I've included links to call me, email me, access my LinkedIn and Github profiles. 

The purpose of this challenge is to set up an online portfolio for the bootcamp giving employers into insight into what I am working on and how I code. This website can be used to navigate my potential employment options, that is, give employers an idea of who I am and what I am capable of accomplishing.
